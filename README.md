3. Feedback about the assignment.

	The assignment looks to be a complete trial to carefully test the the quality of the QA's work. It seems that it is a real QA task at work
	that's been put to assignment. For the same reason, the assignment is pretty interesting and comfortable to relate to. Last but not the least, 
	the support and responsiveness provided during the assignment is great.
